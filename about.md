Hi, I'm Axxon, here I'll share with you, knowledge around coding, music and probably other stuffs.
I started web-development in 2009 with something in mind, create a music service, I came from music studies, and i also wanted to know better computers for the music creation. Nothing in the pockets but a dedicated energy to that. Before starting that, i spoke with some projects managers and finally meet a crew of nice developers and one told me: "Just do it". It was the start of the journey. 

After studies at the university of Limoges, I started my carrier at Paris, first in a startup, but it was quick and disappointing, like 2 months of pure stress, I worked with a clever guy, but he expected someone that asked fewer questions, be more productive, and don't put into question his technical choices. (hey! I was in training contract).

I was lucky to be engaged 2 days later after being fired. And more, meet a magic developer ([Pocky!](https://github.com/pocky)) he was opened for questions and very advanced in his code vision. So he trained me to Symfony, from the intermediate level to more advanced techniques.

After one year in this company Pocky moved and I worked alone on a professional social network platform. It was awesome, but again, to much responsibilities for someone who start on the game.

So I decided to make a pause, learn alone, on a student project, a Rss aggregator, inspired by DDD, here i learned a lot again. After some months of work i realised a prototype. It was pretty cool, a backend completly decoupled from the user interface made with emberjs. 

I showed this project on an IT company at Lyon (Norsys) and was engaged. I worked for few technically interesting projects, during 2 years, met others Wonderful developers like [Mageekguy](https://github.com/mageekguy) who shared with me a lot of him skills like east oriented programming, pure oriented programming, TDD, make, vim ... [Cedvan](https://github.com/cedvan) with him I learned and shared infrastructure problematics (hi docker!) and related question about clean code. And
after all i learn to work in a group context! 

Next, i wanted to work in remote, here it come SensioLabs! 

I made 6 months with this great company but for a health issue i could'nt continue again. So after few months without computer (yeah, someone stole it from me at home before move from Lyon, destiny?),  where i took time for sport, nature, medication, learn about food, and thinking. I'm back, with a good energy, my hearth is better cause finally i learned fundamental things during this time, how to make work my body and mind !

Now i'm working on my music project, will see what will happen next !

Never forget 'the fail learn how to walk', be adventurous, trust in what you're love.

Best regard, 
SÃ©bastien Aka Axxon
